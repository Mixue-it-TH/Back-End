# Intregated Project (Back-End)
### This is a BackEnd used in the Intregated Project course.

### Instruction
The purpose of an Integrated project is to make us familiar with all the working principles of every component of an application. 
By bringing all the parts together, we hope to understand more and be ready to work in the real world. The Backend writed by Spring-boot framework will have a total of 2 versions, a version connected to a single database table and a table with a foreign key. It will be separated into End points starting with /v1,/v2.

### Usecase
Our backend will perform basic functions like CRUD. It will sample results from various endpoints that have been written in the Controller and will test the results through an application like Postman.
